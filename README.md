## Deliverable 1 - Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* What we found was that vehicle length and ground clearance demonstrated a significant random variance impact on MPG. On the flipside, vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD showed non-random variance. 

* The p-value we came up with is significantly smaller than the benchmark of 0.05 to designate statistical signifance, and therefore we cannot reject the null hypothesis. 

* Our R value for this analysis is approximately 71%. What this means for our analysis is that ~71% of the time the model will predict mpg values correctly.
