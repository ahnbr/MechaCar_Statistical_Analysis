## Deliverable 1 - Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* What we found was that vehicle length and ground clearance demonstrated a significant random variance impact on MPG. On the flipside, vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD showed non-random variance. 

* The p-value we came up with is significantly smaller than the benchmark of 0.05 to designate statistical signifance, and therefore we cannot reject the null hypothesis. 

* Our R value for this analysis is approximately 71%. What this means for our analysis is that ~71% of the time the model will predict mpg values correctly.

## Deliverable 2 - Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictates that variance of the suspension coils cannot exceed 100 pounds per square inch. From our analysis it appears that we meet this criteria.
